Module 5 homework

Overall Comment on assignment: This assignment was very challenging, however also very rewarding. Producing the code to create the box plot was the most challenging part of this assignment for me. I looked at another assignment I found (sourced below), got help from AskBCS, and also a DV Tutor on getting the code to work with the for loop and appending the list I created. In the end, open source AI also helped but only to the extent that it checked my code for errors and 'cleaned' up code, it did not tell me how to write code to get the boxplot completed. Overall, I feel like I learned a lot on this assignment and I'm glad we had extra time with the holiday to complete it. 

Analysis on the data:
1. The box plot revealed that the Capomulin and Ramicane drug treaments had lower tumeor volumes as compared to the Infubinol and Capomulin drug treaments. Of the two, the interquartile range of Capomulin was lower at 7.782 compared to Ramicane at 9.099, suggesting that the Compulin treatments were more tightly clustered around the median of the of data. The observations of the mean and standard deviations of Capolumin and Ramicane suggested that the dispursement of the data was similar between the two treatments.
2. The line plot of the Compulin tumor volume over 40+ days showed that the tumor volume peaked at day 20, reached it's lowest at approximately day 35, and increased slighlty by day 50. This data suggest that the drug treatment had a lagged effect on reducing tumor volume for the first 20 days. The subsequent drop in tumor volume over the next 15 days suggested that the build up of the drug in the mouse may have contributed to reducing the tumor size.
3. The scatterplot, line graph and r-squared value of Weight vs Tumor Volume for Capolumin showed that there was a postive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume. Unknown in this study was the dosage of the drug Capolumin: Did each mouse recieve the same amount of treatment, or was the dosage scaled to match the weight and tumor volume of the mouse? Such a study would potentially reveal if larger tumors in large mice were more responsive to larger doses of Capolumin as compared to the smaller mice.
